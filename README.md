# Tap Controller with Servo Motor for Garden Watering

![Tap Controller](tap-controller.jpg)

This project implements a tap controller using a servo motor to automate the watering of your garden. It offers a solution for controlling the water flow without the need for a water solenoid or a pump, ensuring precise control over the water pressure.

## Features

-   Control the tap using a servo motor to adjust water flow.
-   Precise control over water pressure to prevent overwatering.
-   Easy integration with the Blynk IoT platform.
-   Supports OTA firmware updates for easy maintenance.
-   Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and controlling the tap.

## Requirements

-   ESP32s Node MCU or compatible board.
-   Servo motor.
-   Blynk IoT platform account.

## Setup

1.  Connect the servo motor to the ESP32s Node MCU board. Refer to the documentation of your specific board for pin connections.
2.  Install the Blynk library on your Arduino IDE.
3.  Download the code from this repository.
4.  Open the code in Arduino IDE.
5.  Set the ```BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID``` and ```BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME``` values in the code to match your Blynk template ID and name.
6.  Upload the code to your ESP32s Node MCU board.

## Usage

1.  Install the Blynk mobile app on your iOS or Android device.
2.  Create a new Blynk project and configure the necessary widgets (buttons, sliders, etc.) to control the tap.
3.  Use the Blynk app to connect to your device and control the tap flow using the configured widgets.
4.  Adjust the servo position to control the water flow and pressure.

## Code Explanation

The code uses the BlynkEdgent library to enable seamless integration with the Blynk IoT platform. It utilizes the ```BLYNK_WRITE(V0) function``` to receive input from the Blynk app, specifically the desired servo position for controlling the tap. The ```servo.write()``` function is used to set the servo motor to the desired position. The current position is then sent back to the Blynk app using the ```Blynk.virtualWrite()``` function.

In the setup() function, the serial communication is initiated, and the servo is attached to the appropriate pin. ```BlynkEdgent.begin()``` is called to start the Blynk Edgent process. In the loop() function, ```BlynkEdgent.run()``` is continuously executed to handle the communication with the Blynk app.
